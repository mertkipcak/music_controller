# Hand Gesture music controller
This is a simple python project to be able to control the music with just using hand gestures and image recognition.
Mostly made because of "I don't want to yell to siri and push people around to adjust the music". To run the app
install the requirements `opencv-python`, `mediapipe` and run `python main.py`. As I made this on a mac, it will only work on a mac...
